/**
 * The Custom Table Component.
 * This component wraps the material-ui Table component and add some extra functionalities.
 * 1. Table header click. (For sorting)
 * 2. Table row click.
 *
 * The main sort function is defined in the component where the data table is created and passed to the
 * DataTable component via props.
 *
 * Following are the DataTable proptypes.
 *      1. Headers: Table headers. This is an array of Json Objects.
 *                  An Header Object contains the properties of each header. Currently following properties
 *                  are supported.
 *                  * sortable: boolean : whether the table column is sortable or not.
 *                  * sort: func : If sortable, the sort function.
 *                  * sort: func : If sortable, the sort function.
 *                  * sort: func : If sortable, the sort function.
 *                  * label: String: The Table header string.
 *                  * id: String: Unique id for header.
 *
 *      2. Data: The list of data that needs to be displayed in the table.
 *               This is also a json array of data objects.
 *               The Json object should contain key: value pair where the key is the header id.
